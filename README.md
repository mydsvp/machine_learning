* Outlier Discovery Analysis 

Outlier exploratory data discovery analysis for detecting when feature Amount Dispensed has any outlier risk for potential discrepancy for balance computation. This study can serve as the base foundation framework which can be offered as a starting point for building a data quality feedback loop to integrate together into doctor's data practices. For such a quality feedback loop to work effectly, there must be a full complete analysis which can accurately identify outliers that may skew critical computations.

* Cardiovascular heart failures survival analysis

Cardiovascular heart failures analysis, the purpose and effort is to investigate how to use EDA analytics and a basic Random Forest Classifier ensemble model for determining model performance accuracy and precision that might be later developed into are more robust AI ML model apply to the Cardiovascular diseases dataset analysis

* Regression classification for Unbalanced Data Sets

Analytics for unbalanced data classification, investigate a similar algorithm approach in order to ascertain if it is possible to show any improved model accuracy.

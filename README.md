# Machine Learning and Object Detection Code

* Object Detection computer vision

Image detection using multiple computer vision architectures, VGG16, YOLO, YOLO V3, Resnet, Darknet, Tensorflow. Research orinted for computer vision machine learning architecture that fits a match for various images detection, eg., face or vechile or other objects, to be positive to identify via computer vision algorithms.  

* Binary Classification using Multi Class Classification

Binary Classification using Multi Class Classification Development and Performance Compaison using digits
MNIST Digit Recognizer public data. Tune each Binary Classification using RandomizedSearchCV for best fitting hyperparameters with automated parmater assignment in classifer model. Developed the following customized Python Multi-Class classification strategies to research and observe how each binary classifiers (Binary Logistic, Binary Logistic Softmax Regression, Binary Support Vector with RBF Kernal, KNN KNeighbors Classifier for Binary analysis.

OneVsOne & OneVsRest Classifiers
Python LogisticRegression
Python SVC with kernel RBF
Python LogisticRegression Softmax Regression, ie multi_class Mmultinomial
Python KNeighborsClassifier

* Outlier Discovery Analysis 

Outlier exploratory data discovery analysis for detecting when feature Amount Dispensed has any outlier risk for potential discrepancy for balance computation. This study can serve as the base foundation framework which can be offered as a starting point for building a data quality feedback loop to integrate together into doctor's data practices. For such a quality feedback loop to work effectly, there must be a full complete analysis which can accurately identify outliers that may skew critical computations.

* Cardiovascular heart failures survival analysis

Clinical data on Cardiovascular heart failures analysis for serum creatinine and ejection fraction levels for measuring cardiomyopathy. The purpose and effort is to identify correct analysis of serum creatinine and ejection fraction levels for measuring cardiomyopathy, and investigate how to use EDA analytics and a basic Random Forest Classifier ensemble model for determining model performance accuracy and precision that might be later developed into are more robust AI ML model apply to the Cardiovascular diseases dataset analysis

* Regression classification for Unbalanced Data Sets

Analytics for unbalanced data classification, investigate a similar algorithm approach in order to ascertain if it is possible to show any improved model accuracy.
